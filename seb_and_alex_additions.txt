These are notes I took from a meeting with Alex Cope in which we 
discussed what changes we might make to the notes that are already 
present on the software carpentry site.

We need to make this content take about 1.5 hrs, including any time 
during which participants are doing things themselves.

We discussed "The things we really use the shell for" to work out what
we'd like to be sure to incorporate.

find, awk, grep, locate, sed (to a lesser extent), tail, echo, less, which

What about regular expressions? At least a knowledge that they exist? 
(this wasn't discussed in our meeting)

We though we'd like to include something about permissions early on, as 
permissions can easily catch out new users and confuse them.

We also wanted to add sudo early on.

We wanted to get across the concepts of what the shell was developed for 
and why it remains a very popular way to interact with a computer 
system.

Cover & and &&, as well as job control.

Cover bash history and searching it with Ctrl-r

Cover network transparency - the fact that you can scp stuff so easily 
and run arbitrary commands using ssh

Work through some examples on the use of " and ' quotation marks and how 
this means "no spaces in files"!
